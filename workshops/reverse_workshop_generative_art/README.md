# Reverse Workshop: Generative Art

Try to create something like this:



## Template

[A starter template can be found here.](https://hackclub.github.io/live-editor/) 

Click on "Examples" > "Canvas Starter"


## Examples

[Helpful examples can be found here.](https://hackclub.github.io/js-canvas-examples/) 

Copy code snippets from these examples to compose you're drawing. You can only have **one** `draw` function so you'll have to take bits and pieces of each example to put them together.


## Reverse Steps

There are helpful intermediate stages shown below. Try to identify what changes from one example to the next. They are **not** instructions to follow. They are a way of thinking about what makes the original example by taking away components of that drawing one at a time. Try to identify what changes from one video to the next.
