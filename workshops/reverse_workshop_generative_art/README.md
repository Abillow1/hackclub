To run this meeting show your club the example target project. After that have people open up this page. Most of the workshop will be spent in the editor and on the examples page finding useful code snippets (both linked below). It's okay if people don't make the example target exactly. It's a source of inspiration not a prescription.

A few tips:

- Tell people they can only have **one** `draw` function so you'll have to take bits and pieces of each example to put them together.
- As a club leader start out the meeting by demonstrating how to put two code snippets together.
- Encourage people to read each line of the code snippets they are trying to combine. Often they can get themselves "unstuck" just by paying closer attention to details.

## Reverse Steps

There are helpful intermediate stages shown below. Try to identify what changes from one example to the next. They are **not** instructions to follow. They are a way of thinking about what makes the original example by taking away components of that drawing one at a time. Try to identify what changes from one video to the next.
